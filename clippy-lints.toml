# Clippy lint rules applied by run-validate.sh.
# Each [[lints]] block adds a single flag to one cargo clippy invocation.
# To add a new lint, append a new [[lints]] block at the end of this file.
# Separate blocks merge cleanly when multiple workers add rules concurrently.
#
# Fields:
#   name  — the clippy lint (e.g. "clippy::unwrap_used")
#   level — "warn" (-W) or "deny" (-D)
#   scope — "all-targets" (includes tests) or "lib-bins" (production code only)
